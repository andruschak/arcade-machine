# Building... and rebuilding an arcade machine

This is a chronical of a project that took to life in 2011 and is still evolving today. Some of the original information is gone but I will endevour to try and find as much of the original plans as I can.

## A brief history

I love video games. That's it, there is no denying it. I am and always will be a gamer. 

Like most kids in the 80's I was bit by the Atari/Nintendo bug early on. Growing up I had a multitude of game systems and spent more time than I care to admit playing them. I can remember renting a copy of Megaman 3, waking up at 5am to play, so I could sneak in time before my mom booted outside. Ah, the memories... anyway, I digress.

It didn't stop at console games. It branched out to early PC (we're talking 486dx66 days) and of course in my pre/teen years the Arcade. 

Being a maker at heart it only made sense to build my own machine.


### Build criteria

A few of the things I wanted in the build (in no particular order):

- [x] Full sized cabinet (modelled after street fighter/mortal combat dimensions)
- [x] Perfect height for two 6' adults to stand without bumping into each other
- [x] Moderately priced
- [x] Powerful enough to play games like Mortal Kombat 2, Killer Instinct, etc.
- [x] Detachable control panel
- [x] Light up transparent marquee
- [x] Could hold either a CRT or LCD monitor
- [x] Fit a standard ATX midtower
- [x] Adjustable speakers mounted a head height
- [x] Genuine arcade joysticks and 8 buttons per player
- [ ] Themed decals for the sides, marquee and control panel
- [ ] External USB connections
- [ ] Coin slots
- [ ] Roller ball
- [ ] Lightgun support


### The Shell

I had the pleasure of working with an at the time co-worker on this piece (he has since retired). Together we modified some rough plans we found on the internet and went about construction. As with any first go-around there are parts we could have done better but overall I think the results were fantastic.

The shell is "bomb-proof". Overall it stands approximately 6 and a 1/2 feet tall and probably weighs over 100lbs. Plywood was used instead of MDF or press-board and the cabinet was assembled using dowel joints and wood-glue. It is seperated into upper and lower sections held together with 6 long bolts making it easier to move if required. 

Behind the cabinet there is a detachable wooden door held on by 2 spring roller catches. Inside there is ample room for a display and pc. 

There are 2 holes drilled at the top for speakers and the marquee has a removable plexiglass cover with a light behind.

The outside is finished in a textured gray and black paint. At the time I was unable to find anywhere that would do a custom decal for the sides for under $1000
