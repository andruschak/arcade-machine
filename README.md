# Building... and rebuilding an arcade machine

This is a chronical of a project that took to life in 2011 and is still evolving today. Tragedy struck around 6 months ago when the motherboard in the PC died. 

Some of the original information is gone but I will endevour to try and find as much of the original plans as I can.

## A brief history

I love video games. That's it, there is no denying it. I am and always will be a gamer. 

Like most kids in the 80's I was bit by the Atari/Nintendo bug early on. Growing up I had a multitude of game systems and spent more time than I care to admit playing them. I can remember renting a copy of Megaman 3, waking up at 5am to play, so I could sneak in time before my mom booted me outside. 

It didn't stop at console games. It branched out to early PC (we're talking 486dx66 days) and of course in my pre/teen years the Arcade. 

Being a maker at heart it only made sense to build my own machine.


## Build criteria

A few of the things I wanted in the build (in no particular order):

- [x] Full sized cabinet (modelled after street fighter/mortal combat dimensions)
- [x] Perfect height for two 6' adults to stand without bumping into each other
- [x] Moderately priced
- [x] Powerful enough to play games like Mortal Kombat 2, Killer Instinct, etc.
- [x] Detachable control panel
- [x] Light up transparent marquee
- [x] Could hold either a CRT or LCD monitor
- [x] Fit a standard ATX midtower
- [x] Adjustable speakers mounted a head height
- [x] Genuine arcade joysticks and 8 buttons per player
- [ ] Themed decals for the sides, marquee and control panel
- [ ] External USB connections
- [ ] Coin slots
- [ ] Roller ball
- [ ] Lightgun support


## The Shell

I had the pleasure of working with an at the time co-worker on this piece (he has since retired). Together we modified some rough plans we found on the internet and went about construction. As with any first go-around there are parts we could have done better but overall I think the results were fantastic.

The shell is "bomb-proof". Overall it stands approximately 6 and a 1/2 feet tall and probably weighs over 100lbs. Plywood was used instead of MDF or press-board and the cabinet was assembled using dowel joints and wood-glue. It is seperated into upper and lower sections held together with 6 long bolts making it easier to move if required. 

The front panel is removable (unscrewed) to allow for its removal. This was done in the off chance a larger monitor was acquired and the hole needed to be resized.

Behind the cabinet there is a detachable wooden door held on by 2 spring roller catches. Inside there is ample room for a display and pc. 

There are 2 holes drilled at the top for speakers and the marquee has a removable plexiglass cover with a light behind.

The outside is finished in a textured gray and black paint. At the time I was unable to find anywhere that would do a custom decal for the sides for under $1000. An additional compromise was not using trim around the edges and instead opting to have the wood rounded.
